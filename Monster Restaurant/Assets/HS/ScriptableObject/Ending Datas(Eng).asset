  - Speech: 'Maybe I have a talent for this part-time job. I made more money than
      I expected.

      I was thinking about how to spend this money and decided
      to just take over the restaurant. Life is a series of challenges.

      I
      thought this would be better than going back to Earth and paying off my student
      loans and living in a hurry.

      We''ll remodel it and add a menu to make
      it the best restaurant in the universe. Look forward to it.

      Of

      To summarize,

      My Boss says
      that if you make this many mistakes next time, you''ll get me to a singularity
      beyond the event horizon.

      You mean you''ll throw me in a black hole

      far.

      Dressed me in a suit, served me a delicious meal at a fancy restaurant,

      him.

      That''s why he really wanted to bring me here.

      I''m sorry
      to say this to Mr. Sock, but I think he should take a shower in the washing
